Assignment

1. Identify the primary keys and foreign keys in maven movies db. Discuss the differences.

describe actor; 
describe actor_award; 
describe address;
describe advisor;
describe category;
describe customer;
describe film
describe film_actor
describe film_category
describe film_text
describe inventory
describe investor
describe language
describe payment
describe rental
describe staff
describe store

From the above queries, we will get primary keys and foreign keys. The difference between these two keys is that a primary key is unique within the table and the same key used for reference in another table acts like a foreign key.
eg. actor_id is primary key in 'actor' table whereas acts as a foreign key in 'actor_award' table
